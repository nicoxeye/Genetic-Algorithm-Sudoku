            - Generate offspring from selected parents
            - Apply crossover and mutation
            - Evaluate fitness
            - Track best individual so far

### FITNESS EXPLANATION

- each row, column, and box can contribute up to 9 unique digits
- there are 9 rows + 9 columns + 9 boxes = 27 groups

which means a fully valid Sudoku with no repeats anywhere
